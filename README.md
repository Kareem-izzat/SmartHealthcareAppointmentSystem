# Smart Healthcare Appointment System
A modern Spring Boot 3 application designed to streamline hospital management, allowing patients, doctors, and administrators to efficiently handle appointments, prescriptions, and medical records. The system combines relational databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for structured data and MongoDB for flexible prescription and medical record storage developed as a part of my training at Exalt LTD.  

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure login with **JWT**
- Paged Endpoints
- Role-based access:
  - **Admin:** Manage doctors and patients.  
  - **Doctor:** Handle appointments and prescriptions.  
  - **Patient:** Book or cancel appointments, view prescriptions and medical records.  

### Doctor Management
- Admins can add, update, register or remove doctors.  
- Patients can search doctors by **specialty**.  
- Doctor data is cached for fast access using Hibernateâ€™s caching mechanisms.  

### Patient Management
- Admins can add, update, remove or register new patients.  
- Patients can update personal information.  

### Appointment & Slot System
- Each doctor defines their own **available slots**.  
- Patients can select a slot that fits their schedule.
- Patient Book/Cancel appointmens
- The system prevents **double-booking** by checking slot availability.  
- Doctors can mark appointments as completed.  
- Booking and cancellation actions are logged using **Spring AOP**.  

### Prescription & Medical Records
- Doctors can add prescriptions and notes for patients.  
- All prescriptions are stored in **MongoDB** for flexibility.  
- Patients can view their prescription history and lab reports.
- a medical record will be created for every patient and it will contain all of his medical info.

### Logging
- Uses **Spring AOP** to log key actions:  
  - Appointment bookings and cancellations.  
  - Prescription creation.  
- Detailed logs help track user actions and system behavior.  

### Testing
- JUnit and Mockito used to test:  
  - Appointment booking logic, including double-booking prevention.  
  - CRUD operations for doctors and patients.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3 with REST APIs.  
- **Database Layer:**  
  - Relational DB Postgres for structured data like doctors, patients, and appointments.  
  - MongoDB for unstructured data like prescriptions and medical records.  
- **Security:** Spring Security with role-based authorization with JWT.  
- **Caching:** Hibernate first- and second-level caching for frequently accessed entities (e.g., doctors).  
- **Logging:** Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for tracking actions.  
- **Testing:** Unit and integration testing with JUnit + Mockito.
